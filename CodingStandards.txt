                                    High Availability

High availability  refers to the design and implementation of systems and services that aim to ensure a continuous and reliable operation, minimizing downtime and disruptions.
The goal of high availability is to provide a level of operational performance that prevents a single point of failure from causing a service interruption.

                       Key Features of High Availability

    1.Redundancy:Incorporating duplicate components or systems to provide backups ensures that if one fails, another can seamlessly take over. Redundancy can be applied at different levels, including hardware, software, and network components.

  2.Fault Tolerance: Building systems with the capability to withstand and recover from faults or failures. 

  3.Automatic Failover:Implementing mechanisms that automatically redirect traffic or workload to backup systems or components when a failure is detected.
 
  4.Load Balancing:Distributing incoming network traffic or workload across multiple servers or resources to prevent overloading and optimize resource utilization.
 
  5.Scalability:Designing systems to be scalable so that they can handle increased workloads and demand. 

  6.Geographic Redundancy:Distributing resources across multiple geographical locations to protect against regional outages or disasters.

  7.Data Backup and Recovery:Regularly backing up critical data and implementing robust recovery mechanisms. 

   8.Security Measures: Incorporating strong security practices to protect against cyber threats and unauthorized access. 

   9.Documentation:Maintaining thorough documentation of the system architecture, configurations, and procedures for handling failures. 

    10.Continuous Improvement:Adopting a mindset of continuous improvement by regularly reviewing and updating high availability strategies based on evolving technology, business requirements, and lessons learned from previous incidents.

                                                            Auto-Scaling
Autoscaling also known as automatic scaling, is a cloud computing feature that allows resources such as compute instances, virtual machines, or containers to automatically adjust based on the actual workload or demand.
